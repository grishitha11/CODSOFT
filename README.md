CALACULATOR:
This code creates a basic calculator using Python's Tkinter library. Here's a breakdown in simpler terms:

The calculator has buttons for numbers (0-9), arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /), parentheses, a decimal point, delete (D), clear (C), and equals (=).

There's a text display area where the numbers and operations you select are shown.

Each number and operation button has a function that adds the corresponding symbol to the calculation being displayed in the text area.

The "C" button clears the entire calculation, while the "D" button deletes the last entered symbol.

The "=" button evaluates the calculation shown in the text area and displays the result.

If there's an error in the calculation, such as dividing by zero, it shows an "Error" message in the display area.



TO-DO-LIST:
This code creates a simple To-Do List application using Tkinter, a Python GUI library. Here's a breakdown in simpler terms:
The application window appears with a title "To-Do-List" and certain dimensions.
There are two sections in the window: one for adding tasks and the other for displaying tasks.
The "Add Task" section includes a text box where users can type in tasks and an "Add" button to add these tasks to the list.
The "Tasks" section displays the added tasks in a list format.
Users can select a task from the list and press the "Delete" button to remove it from the list.
Tasks are saved in a file named "data.txt" so that even after closing the application, the tasks remain stored and can be retrieved when the application is opened again.
The code uses functions like add to add tasks to the list and save them in the "data.txt" file, and delete to remove selected tasks from both the displayed list and the "data.txt" file.
When the application starts, it reads tasks from the "data.txt" file and displays them in the list.
Overall, this is a basic To-Do List application allowing users to add tasks, view them in a list, and delete tasks they've completed.



ROCK PAPER SCISSORS GAME:
This code creates a simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game using Python's Tkinter for the graphical interface. Here's a breakdown in simpler terms:

The game has a dictionary that defines the winning scenarios for Rock, Paper, and Scissors. It keeps track of scores for the computer and the player.

There's a function called outcome_handler that gets triggered when a player selects Rock, Paper, or Scissors. It randomly generates the computer's choice and compares it with the player's choice to determine the winner, updating the scores accordingly. The interface displays the choices made by the player and the computer, the current scores, and the outcome of each round.

The main window of the game has labels displaying the game title, the instruction to select an option, and the scores for the player and computer. There are buttons for Rock, Paper, and Scissors that trigger the outcome_handler function when clicked. The outcomes and choices are displayed below the buttons.



CONTACT BOOK:
This Python code creates a simple contact book GUI application using the Tkinter library. The application allows users to manage a list of contacts by adding, deleting, and editing their information.

Upon execution, the program opens a window displaying a list of contacts with their associated email addresses and phone numbers. Users can interact with the contact list using three main buttons:

Add: Opens prompts to input a new contact's name, email, and phone number. Once provided, this information gets added to the contact list.
Delete: Removes the selected contact from the list upon user confirmation via a dialog box.
Edit: Allows users to modify the email and phone number of the selected contact through dialog prompts.
The contact information is stored within the application in a dictionary format, with each contact's name serving as the key and a nested dictionary containing their email and phone number as the value.

The application's graphical interface is straightforward, utilizing buttons for actions and a listbox to display the contact details. Dialog prompts are used to input new information or confirm changes, ensuring user interaction and data management within the contact book.
